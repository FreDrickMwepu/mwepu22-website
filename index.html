                    I was granted the rare privilege to be part of the Zambia Institution for 
                    Sustainable Development’s (ZISD) Zambian National Robotics Team for the year 
                    2022. The Zambia Robotics team has competed in the FIRST Global Cup, which is an
                    annual international Olympic-style event that brings youth from over 
                    190 countries to compete in a robotics tournament, with themes that range 
                    from using renewable energy to clearing the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, 
                    all created with the incense of allowing young people to become more aware of 
                    global predicaments affecting humanity, so they may one day drive STEM-based solutions 
                    to solve those problems. Apart from participation in the FIRST Global Robotics 
                    Competition, Zambia Robotics has worked towards bridging the gap between ideating 
                    and creating, by providing young people with hands-on learning experiences through 
                    robotics as they envision a country in which young people take a leading role in
                    advancing the nation STEM wise and creating African-born solutions to challenges.

                <p> I was accorded a chance to volunteer as a training facilitator for an ICT awareness 
                    program organized by The Africa Code Week to teach young people (especially Young girls) 
                    of various ages coding skills by learning how to programme using scratch programming 
                    in several communities. It was a perfect opportunity for me to make a difference by 
                    giving back to my community. Today It makes me happy to know that I am among the many

                <p> 
                    While still in secondary school, I worked as a child’s rights activist and made several 
                    involvements in that regard. With the help of our pupils who volunteered to be part of 
                    this great cause and special permission from the school management, we were enabled to 
                    form The Children's Rights Club (CRC). We brought quite a number of pupils across all 
                    grades and we could meet on a weekly basis as a club to discuss various problems that 
                    affected young people. In these meetings, we created a medium through which pupils expressed 
                    their views towards various social challenges that affected them with the aim of finding ways
                    of how best we could work together to address them. We created this vibrant space 
                    that amplified their talents and abilities, such insightful activities were rejuvenating 
                    and this attracted a lot of pupils to join the club. Besides those gatherings, we also 
                    had outreach activities where a few members of the club would visit their local communities 
                    to help sensitize the general public on the effects of child abuse and other vices 
                    that affected the children's wellbeing.
